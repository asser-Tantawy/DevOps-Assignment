# Troubleshooting DNS/Network Issues with Internal Web Dashboard

## 1. Verify DNS Resolution

First, let's check how the hostname resolves with different DNS servers:

```bash
# Check current DNS server configuration
cat /etc/resolv.conf

# Test resolution with system DNS servers
dig internal.example.com

# Test with Google's public DNS
dig @8.8.8.8 internal.example.com
```
This comparison will show if there's a discrepancy between how my internal DNS resolves the hostname versus public DNS. If internal DNS shows no A record or resolves to an incorrect IP, that's our first clue.

## 2. Diagnose Service Reachability

Once we have the IP address (let's assume it's 192.168.1.1), let's verify if the web service is actually running:

```bash
# Test HTTP 
curl -v http://192.168.1.1

# Check if ports are open
nmap -p 443 192.168.1.1
nmap -p 80 192.168.1.1

# Try to telnet 
telnet 192.168.1.1 80
telnet 192.168.1.1 443
```

On the server itself, we can check if the service is listening:

```bash
#  test it with netstat
netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':(80|443)'
```

## 3. Trace the Issue - All Possible Causes

### DNS-Related Issues:
1. **DNS server failure**: Internal DNS server is down or unreachable
2. **Missing/incorrect DNS records**: The A record for internal.example.com is missing, outdated, or pointing to the wrong IP
3. **DNS misconfiguration**: Internal vs external DNS views could be misaligned
4. **DNS server order**: Wrong order in /etc/resolv.conf causing external lookups before internal
5. **DNS resolution timeout**: DNS server responses are too slow

### Network/Service Layer Issues:
6. **Firewall blocking**: Firewalls (server, network, or client) blocking access to ports 80/443
7. **Routing problems**: Network routes between clients and server are broken
8. **IP address conflict**: Another system using the same IP as your web server
9. **Web server service down**: Apache/Nginx/etc. not running on the server
10. **Configuration changes**: Recent changes to network or server configuration
11. **Network interface issues**: NIC down or misconfigured on the server

## 4. Propose and Apply Fixes

### For DNS Server Failure:

**Confirm root cause**:
```bash
# Check if we can reach the DNS server
ping $(grep nameserver /etc/resolv.conf | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')

# Check DNS server service status (if it's on the same network)
ssh dns-server "systemctl status named"
```

**Fix commands**:
```bash
# Restart DNS service on DNS server
ssh admin@dns-server
sudo systemctl restart named

# Or point to a working DNS server temporarily
sed -i '1s/^/nameserver 1.1.1.1\n/' /etc/resolv.conf
```

### For Missing/Incorrect DNS Records:

**Confirm root cause**:
```bash
# Check the DNS zone file directly on the DNS server
ssh admin@dns-server
cat /var/named/example.com.zone
```

**Fix commands**:
```bash
# Add or update the A record (on DNS server)
ssh admin@dns-server
sudo vim /var/named/example.com.zone
# Add: internal DNS
```

### For Local DNS Cache Issues:

**Confirm root cause**:
```bash
# Check local DNS cache entries
sudo systemd-resolve --statistics
```

**Fix commands**:
```bash
# Flush local DNS cache based on your system
# For systemd-resolved:
sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches

# For nscd:
sudo systemctl restart nscd

# For dnsmasq:
sudo systemctl restart dnsmasq
```

### For Firewall Blocking:

**Confirm root cause**:
```bash
# Test with firewall temporarily disabled on client
sudo systemctl stop firewalld  # or ufw or iptables

# Check firewall rules on server
ssh admin@webserver "sudo iptables -L -n"
```

**Fix commands**:
```bash
# Add firewall exception for HTTP/HTTPS (for firewalld)
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload

# For iptables:
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```

### For Web Server Service Down:

**Confirm root cause**:
```bash
# Check if web service is running
ssh admin@webserver "systemctl status nginx"  # or apache2/httpd
```

**Fix commands**:
```bash
# Start the web service
ssh admin@webserver "sudo systemctl start nginx"  # or apache2/httpd

# Enable to start on boot
ssh admin@webserver "sudo systemctl enable nginx"
```

## 5. Setting up Local hosts Entry (Bonus)

To bypass DNS temporarily and verify if the web service itself works:

```bash
# Add entry to /etc/hosts
sudo sh -c "echo '10.0.0.100 internal.example.com' >> /etc/hosts"
```

Test access:
```bash
curl -v http://internal.example.com
```

To remove the entry when done:
```bash
sudo sed -i '/internal\.example\.com/d' /etc/hosts
```

## 6. Persisting DNS Settings (Bonus)

### Using systemd-resolved:

```bash
# edit the dns_servers.conf
sudo vim /etc/systemd/resolved.conf.d/dns_servers.conf
# add this to the file DNS=192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 Domains=example.com and save it

# Restart the service
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

### Using NetworkManager:

```bash
# Add DNS server to a connection 
sudo nmcli connection modify "connection" ipv4.dns "192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2 "
sudo nmcli connection modify "connection" ipv4.dns-search "example.com"

# Restart connection to apply changes
sudo nmcli connection down "Ethernet" && sudo nmcli connection up "Ethernet"
```
